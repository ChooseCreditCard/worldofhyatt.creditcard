    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Hotel-Loyalty Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A hotel-loyalty credit card is linked directly to a hotel group’s rewards program. Instead of earning cash back, you build a balance of points that can be redeemed for free nights, discounted stays or room upgrades at participating properties.</p>
      <p>Programs like World of Hyatt, Marriott Bonvoy, IHG One and similar ecosystems reward you for concentrating bookings within their brands. A co-branded credit card extends that concept to your everyday purchases, adding a second stream of points and often granting automatic elite status.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning Points -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Hotel Cards Earn Points on Stays and Spend</h2>
      <p>Hotel cards usually award an elevated earn rate when you pay for stays at participating hotels — often stacking with the base points you earn as a loyalty member. On top of that, you earn a fixed rate of points per unit of spend on general purchases, and sometimes higher rates on categories like dining, travel or transport.</p>
      <p>Many co-branded cards also include welcome bonuses and milestone bonuses. Hitting a certain spend level in a year can unlock extra points, free-night certificates or qualifying nights that help you climb to the next elite tier faster.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Status & Benefits -->
    <section id="benefits" class="section">
      <h2>Elite Status, Free Nights and On-Property Perks</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest draws of a hotel-loyalty card is status. Even entry-level cards might grant a base tier that includes benefits like late checkout or bottled water, while premium cards can offer mid-tier status with room upgrades, bonus points and access to better availability.</p>
      <p>Free-night certificates are another key benefit. These can be earned through sign-up bonuses or annual card anniversaries and redeemed for stays up to a defined category or point value. Used strategically on higher-category properties, certificates can offset a significant portion of the card’s annual fee.</p>

    <!-- Value & Trade-Offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How to Judge Whether a Hotel Card Is Worth It</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Your stay pattern:</strong> How often you actually stay in the hotel group’s properties each year.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic coverage:</strong> Whether the chain has strong presence where you typically travel.</li>
        <li><strong>Annual fee vs. perks:</strong> Compare the fee with the value of free nights, status and credits you realistically use.</li>
        <li><strong>Point value:</strong> Typical cash-equivalent value per point on the routes and hotels you care about.</li>
        <li><strong>Competing options:</strong> Whether a flexible travel-rewards card could give similar or better value without locking you in.</li>
      </ul>
